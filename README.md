Alpha
============

Alpha is a random quote, fortune and word generator. Alpha was built as a little side project to help familiarize my self with Swift. The app is currently available in the app store, you can download it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alpha-random-quotes-fortunes/id906520811).

## Contributing

Alpha is always looking for more quotes, fortunes and words to be added to the next release of Alpha. Rules to follow when adding quotes, fortunes and words

- If you are adding quotes to the file for example, please add the quote at the bottom of the quote.plist file and have the associated author included.
- If you are adding a quote for example, please add the quote on the left as it’s ‘key’ and the author as the ‘value’.
